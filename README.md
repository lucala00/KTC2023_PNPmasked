# Code for KTC2023 EIT challenge (Plug&Play approach + post-processing)


## Brief description of the algorithm
This repository contains the Python files required by the organisers of the EIT Kuopio challenge 2023 which implements a Plug&Play approach with a post-processing step where synthetic (data-independent) masks are superimposed on the obtained reconstruction to improve results.
Training was performed with GT simulated data with random polygons of different shapes and postive/negative contrast.
Associated noisy versions were computed running a regularised Gauss-Newton algorithm for few iterations on the corresponding measurements.

## Installation instructions and requirements

For installation and required environment see the environment_pnp.yml to restore the conda enviroment used for the submission. 
You can create the enviroment using the following command:

```conda env create -f environment.yml```

We created a script main.py to reconstruct the inclusions provided for training from voltage measurements:

```python main.py /path_to_input_folder /path_to_ouput_folder difficulty_level```
